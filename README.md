For writeup and documentation, open static/login.html in a web browser.

Once you have launched the application with `make run`, navigate to localhost:5000 in the web browser to see the API docs rendered with fully correct endpoints (instead of the file:// you see when reading the raw HTML file that is not served over the webserver).
